# A sample data definition for a fictional wine cellar management application
# The basic model is:
#    bottle - canonical form of a wine bottle description
#    user - a user of the system
#    cellar - a collection of bottles
#    tasting_note - one user's perceptions of a bottle (which may or may not be in the user's cellar)
